# Code-Sample
This is a project done for senior design at Georgia Tech. 
The concept of the project was to sequence products in such a way that would minimize the amount of defective products in between SKUs.
This was equivalent to finding the "shortest path" throughout the products. 
Due to limitations of freeware optimization software, a heuristic utilizing Eulerian tours was developed and implemented here.
I was the sole developer of the algorithm section of the code, while the GUI aspect was a group effort.
